create a terraform module with main, tfvars, outputs. this will be imported by another terraform project

this will set up a cloud load balancer to forward to the application defined in ../cloud-run and provide standard HTTPS/gcp managed certificates

it will only accept connections through the IAP and should force unauthenticated requests to authenticate with google through IAP in ../cloud-iap
