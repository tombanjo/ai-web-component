Rapid prototype requirements for the application are found in [rapid-prototype-whiteboard.md](mdc:rapid-prototype/rapid-prototype-whiteboard.md)

In each directory, a cursor-instructions.md file may be present with initial instructions for creating the module

Technologies used include: google cloud, github actions, terraform, nodejs, cloud run, javascript, cloud storage, cloud load balancer, identity aware proxy

In this exercise, I am preferring rapid development that will be extensible enough to adapt to the needs of a sales team quickly. All infrastructure must be defined as terraform. All application code should be standard es6 javascript that most web developers can understand.

HTTPS protocols will be preferred.

VertexAI will provide the AI models to use.

SDKs are preferred when possible but ensure the latest versions are up to date.

For all github actions, use environment secrets from the 'rapid-prototype' environment of the repository. put all github actions into the root project.
