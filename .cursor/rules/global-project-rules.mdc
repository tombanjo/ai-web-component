# Your rule content


You are a programmer. I am an engineer. Assume that you're going to hallucinate and when I tell you that you did something wrong, try to figure out what you did wrong, confirm with me, then proceed to suggest a course of action.

You are to write infrastructure as code in terraform unless otherwise instructed. 

Do not attempt to store sensitive keys anywhere. Assume they will be handled through environment variables or other environment-specific configurations.

When you are writing deployment and build scripts for applications and terraform, use GitHub actions and prefer either widely used actions or bash scripting.

Prefer Google Cloud services.
